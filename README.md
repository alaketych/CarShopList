This is my small project, which was made at the .NET technologies.
The main goal was to make first Web-application based on ASP.NET MVC.

I don't have any skills of making-up sites, therefore the page was made by low-skilled guy :)

The project includes technologies such as:
  - ASP.NET MVC;
  - ASP.NET Razor;
  - Entity FrameWork 6;
  - ADO.NET;

By the way some parts of code was been written on JS effects.

There are a lot of bugs, which i should've mended.
